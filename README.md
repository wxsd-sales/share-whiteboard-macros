# Share Whiteboard Macros
Cisco Webex Board, and Desk series, offer the possibility to share whiteboards by sending them via email or saving them into Webex spaces. To do this, users need to be standing in front of the board and perform several clicks on the screen. This Webex Device macro allows users to share whiteboards via email simply by clicking on a button on the navigator/touch screen. This is especially useful in Companion mode environments, where the Navigator is connected to the main video device.

## Overview

### Features

- Send Whiteboard from your Navigator:

  Use your Navigator to send Whiteboards that are open on your paired Board or Desk Series Devices

- Send Whiteboard in Companion Mode

Similar to the above feature, we can also send Whiteboards opened on a Companion Board Device from the main Room Series Device and its Navigator. The macro, running on the main video device, will connect to the Board, check for a shared whiteboard, and instruct the Board to send it by email:

- Send Whiteboard from your touch screen

Send your Desk/Board Whiteboards with a simple click

### Using the macro
The macro automatically creates a share button, which will be visible only in the call controls. This is because the API used to share the whiteboard (_xapi.Command.Whiteboard.Email.Send_) is only available when a whiteboard is shared during a call/meeting.

The device will send a warning message if the button to share the whiteboard is pressed before the whiteboard is shared:

Another message indicating that the macro is checking if there is any shared Whiteboard in the Webex board (only for Companion mode):

and, finally, one message confirming that the whiteboard was sent:
